# PalletStrappingLaborModel
Calculates the number of pallets that require strapping given detailed pick history. CleanShipData.py allows for a folder of ship data csv files to be automatically cleaned, reformatted and uploaded into the SQL database. From there, the SQL query can be run to model labor for pallet strapping. A sample file of how the data comes from our Business Objects account is shown, it's difficult to understand before being reformatted and decoded. There is also a function matrix given to reflect how number of banded pallets is determined for this particular site. Sample data is also given. The sample data does not reflect actual data from my employer or our customers. It was generated separately as an example.
